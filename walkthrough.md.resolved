# MindAlert - Walkthrough

## Overview
MindAlert is a high-fidelity, mobile-first React application designed for dementia detection and cognitive monitoring. It runs entirely locally in the browser with no external API dependencies.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication Flow
- **Entry Point**: A welcoming screen that asks for the user's name (e.g., "Grandpa").
- **State Management**: The name is stored in the local app state and persists during the session.

### 2. Home Dashboard
- **Risk Level**: A visual progress bar indicating 'Low', 'Moderate', or 'High' risk based on test performance.
- **Navigation**: Large, accessible cards for the three main modules: Memory Test, Activity Tracker, and Caregiver Notes.
- **Aesthetic**: Uses the "Trustworthy Health" palette (Teal, Blue, Orange) with glassmorphism effects.

### 3. Daily Memory Test
- **Multi-step Wizard**:
  1.  **Text Question**: "What is your son's name?"
  2.  **Image Recognition**: Uses uploaded family/city images.
  3.  **Object ID**: Identifies objects from images.
- **Logic**: Scores the quiz and updates the global "Risk Level" dynamically.

### 4. Activity Tracker
- **Visualization**: A weekly bar chart (powered by `recharts`) showing completed tasks.
- **Status Cards**: Highlights sleep pattern changes and missed tasks.

### 5. Caregiver Notes
- **Local Logic Engine**: Type a note (e.g., "Patient was confused"). The app analyzes keywords:
  -   'lost', 'aggressive' -> **Urgent**
  -   'forgot', 'confused' -> **Concerning**
  -   Default -> **Stable**
- **History**: Displays a list of tagged notes with timestamps.

## Technical Details
- **Stack**: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Styling**: [index.css](file:///Users/rahulshirol/.gemini/antigravity/brain/3a648b5a-7f95-45c3-830a-80a89f10f15b/src/index.css) configured with Tailwind v4 `@theme` variables.
- **Build**: Passes `tsc` and `vite build`.

## Verification
- **Build Status**: ✅ Success
- **Type Check**: ✅ No errors
- **Manual Test**: Run `npm run preview` to test the full flow.
